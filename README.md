# The Rook's Tour
A 4x4 simulation of The Rook's Tour game for [**LOGIKA UI 2022**](https://www.logikaui.com/).

*Made by me and [Darren Lionardo](https://github.com/Darren-Lionardo).*

> "Maneuver a rook about an otherwise unoccupied chess board in such a way that it lands on every square once and only once.   The rook may not pass through a previously occupied square." - [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/more-puzzles/rooks-tour)
